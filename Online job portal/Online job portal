This Online Job Portal project is designed to connect job seekers with employers through a user-friendly web interface. It includes features like login, registration, job listings, and profile management. The portal uses HTML for structure, CSS and Bootstrap for responsive and professional design, and JavaScript for interactive form validation and dynamic feedback. It provides a clean, modular, and extensible foundation for building a functional job recruitment system.
